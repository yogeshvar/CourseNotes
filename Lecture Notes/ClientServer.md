## Client & Server 

### Architecture

- A Network Architecture in which each Computer or Process is either a Client or Server.
- Client are just UI interactions..
- What is resources ?
    * Client just request something from the frontend
    * what processing, how memory is used.
- Server -> respond to response from a client.. 
- Talk about stadia servers 


#### Eg 1:
* Alice owns many devices -> synchronize data -> store it in cloudÂ  (cloud is not secured, some gov sector has access to cloud )
* Bob wants to transfer money Alice; Bob sends from $100 to Alice(India) -> alice wont get want Bob sends..Â 
* Centralized server -> to decentralized server
* Fault Tolerance, shared resources, direct interaction, self-admin, redundancy, decentralized management..Â 
* p2p libraries ->Â 
* media streaming -> spotify, bittorrent
* VOIP (voice over IP)Â  -> skypeÂ 
* Financial services - BitcoinÂ 


#### Eg 2:
* Direct download is not download..Â 
* Files is saved as chunks
* Tracker will find the peersÂ 
* Downloaders as sources

example of IRTC chat roomsÂ  - irrsi -> /connect freenode -> /whois & /clear /exit /ban /msg /names
mail server of Gmail - SMTP working

Proxy servers - Proxy pattern, use a proxy in chrome and check the IP..Â 
Audio/Video Servers - NAS (Network attached storage) , SAN (Storage area storage)
Telnet servers - text oriented communication,Â 
Web servers - All websites
Chat servers - IRC chats was the first step..Â 
Z39.50 server - standard client serverÂ 
Groupware server - allows the collaboration of users, irrespective of location through the internet or intranet to work together in an atmosphere which is virtual.

### Web based application

1st Tier:
* Presentation tier (Web browser, UI interactions)
2nd Tier:
* Application logic (application implementation) (letâ€™s say I have facebook and user wants to get the friends
* Business logic (Business logic, the user should get frequently chat friends, and new friends in first)
3rd Tier:
* Data access (DB processing)
n - tier -> distributed architecture
