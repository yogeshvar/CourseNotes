## Day 1:

Alan Turning → Cambridge Mathematician
Cipher machine 1920s
Single encoded message → 159 million million settings (Only one is correct)
Single Person → 100 hundreds
Nazi change the settings when clock hits
Polish mathematician & cryptologist Marian → not known much

How pubg works ? → Software operability, Client Server
Client → Load Balancers → Patch if available → Login Creds → World Server → Game Server → Area Server
A1 Area → A2 Area (Sniper Shot)


API: System.out.println() 

## Architecture: 
Architecture is the process of planning, designing, and constructing or building a systems, Software, etc

## Deployment: 
Process of put some resource in place to make it work or perform some action

## configuration: 
To make the software system behaves well we need right configuration

## Storage:
Action of storing or keeping it safe somewhere for future usage.
In simple reserving something for future 

## Monitoring:
An exam invigilator, exam proctor or exam supervisor is someone who is appointed by the examination board and services for maintaining the proper conduct of a particular examination in accordance with the exam regulations.Â 
* Before the examÂ 
* During Exam
* After Exam
Ask What is Monitoring? To crowd.
Monitoring is the process of watching the system, software or what ever its and collecting the metrics.
(or) Monitoring is the process of collecting, aggregating, and analyzing metrics, logs values to improve awareness of your componentâ€™s,systemâ€™s characteristics and behavior.Â 

## Performance: 
Bolt => our software
What is 37.58 km/s? => Speed
100m, 200m, 400mx4 ? => ScalabilityÂ 
Fitness throughout the year ? => Stability

Performance is determined byÂ 
Speed
Scalability
Stability
## Improve:
1. With loads of people(same time) => Load testingÂ 
2. Beach running => Stress testingÂ 
3. Previous Stats => Endurance testing => over a long period of timeÂ 
4. Handicapped racing => Spike testing => sudden load or operation
5. Bulk participants => volume testingÂ 
6. Increase in participants => Scalability testing
## Problems: 
1. Not Quick Start => long load time
2. Reactive => response timeÂ 
3. Cannot withstand lots of people => poor scalability
4. Not Smart enough => bottlenecking 

## Scaling: 
System or set up being able to scale based on amount work to be done

## Fault Tolerance:
When one burner gets down then instantly we can switch to another burner with low down time

## HA: 
Restoration time might be thereÂ
