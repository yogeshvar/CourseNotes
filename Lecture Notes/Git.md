### Git 

Version control since 1925 

SCCS - source code control system 

IBM - 
Written in SNOBOL and the re written in C for Unix.


In previous lectures, Christoph mentioned we can use scripts if we want. Making a webpage for the GitHub profile summary using Github API v4. And a 2 page report for their journey. Can a report done this way?
Problem
* Source code takes up too much space because it is repeated in every version.
* It is hard to acquire information about when and where changes occurred.
* Finding the exact version which the client has problems with is difficult.
How it works:
SCCS files, SCCS commands

Goals
* Speed
* Simple design
* Strong support for non-linear development (thousands of parallel branches)
* Fully distributed
* Able to handle large projects like the Linux kernel efficiently (speed and data size)
