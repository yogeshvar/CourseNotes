## Course Structure by [TekTutor](https://github.com/tektutor)

This course contains the following topics:

- BDD Test
- Ant
- Design Patterns
- ML Basics
- Rest Client and Web Services
- Soap Client and Web Services
- Docker
- Kubertenes

Few topics are organized into a separate folder, with code examples included. To get started, simply navigate to the folder for the topic you wish to review the code examples provided.

## <u><i>BDD Test</i></u>: 

The BDD Test folder contains code examples for Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD) testing. This methodology is used to write tests that can be read and understood by both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

## <u><i>Ant</i></u>:

The Ant folder contains code examples for Apache Ant, a Java-based build tool. Ant provides a flexible and powerful build system that makes it easy to compile, test, and package Java applications.

---

## <u><i>Design Patterns</i></u>:

The Design Patterns folder contains code examples for various design patterns. Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems in software development. Understanding and applying design patterns can help you write more maintainable and scalable code.

---

## <u><i>ML Basics</i></u>:

The ML Basics folder contains code examples for the basics of machine learning. This includes introduction to ML algorithms, feature selection and preprocessing, model training and evaluation, and deployment.

---

## <u><i>Rest Client and Web Services</i></u>:

The Rest Client and Web Services folder contains code examples for consuming and creating RESTful web services. REST (Representational State Transfer) is a popular architectural style for building web services.

---

## <u><i>Soap Client and Web Services</i></u>:

The Soap Client and Web Services folder contains code examples for consuming and creating SOAP-based web services. SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a protocol for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services.

---

## <u><i>Docker</i></u>:

A platform for building, shipping, and running distributed applications. Docker allows you to package your application and its dependencies into a single unit, called a container, that can be easily deployed and run on any environment.

---

## <u><i>Kubernetes</i></u>:

An open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Kubernetes provides a platform for deploying, scaling, and operating applications in a consistent and automated manner, making it easier to manage and maintain large-scale applications.

Hope that you find this helps in your software development journey. Enjoy your learning!
